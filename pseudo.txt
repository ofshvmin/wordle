- a function will run to choose a 5 letter word at random from a dataset of words
- if word is not present in the usedWords array populate the word in the correctWord variable

user should be able to click on the onscreen keyboard or type using their physical keyboard

the clicked or typed letter should populate the corresponding letter into the squares from left to right in the order they are selected
    - continued typing once the first 5 boxes in the first row are full should visually display to the user they have selected an invalid input (shake the tile)
    - the user should be able to delete their inputs using the backspace key or button
